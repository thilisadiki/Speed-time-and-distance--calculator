# Distance, Time, and Speed Calculator

This is a simple web application that allows you to calculate distance, time, or speed based on the values you provide. You can choose different units for each metric, making it easier to work with your preferred units.

## Features

- Calculate distance, time, or speed by providing two of the three values
- Select units for distance (kilometers or meters)
- Select units for time (hours, minutes, or seconds)
- Select units for speed (km/h, km/min, or m/s)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Use

1. Open the website in your preferred web browser.
2. Enter two of the three values: distance, time, or speed.
3. Select the appropriate units for each value using the dropdown menus.
4. Click the "Calculate" button.
5. The result will be displayed in the designated area, showing the calculated value and its unit.

For example, if you enter a distance of 50 kilometers and a time of 2 hours, leaving the speed field blank, the calculator will determine the speed and display the result as "Speed = 6.94 m/s".
